To add sample records to your User table (or any model in Django), you can follow these steps:

Option 1: Using the Django Admin Panel
If you already have the Django admin set up, you can add records directly from the admin interface.

Create a superuser (if you haven't already) using this command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
You'll be prompted to enter a username, email, and password.

Access the Admin Interface: Once the superuser is created, run the server again:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Then, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin in your browser.

Login to the Admin Panel: Log in with the superuser credentials you created.

Add Users: In the admin panel, go to the "Users" section (or the relevant section for your User model) and click "Add user" to add a new user manually. Fill in the details, including any custom fields such as full_name, phone_no, etc.

Option 2: Using the Django Shell
You can add sample records directly from the Django shell.

Open Django Shell:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py shell
Create a New User Record:

Inside the shell, you can create a user like this:

python
Copy code
from users.models import User

# Create a new user instance
user = User.objects.create(
    username="sampleuser",
    full_name="Sample User",
    email="sampleuser@example.com",
    phone_no="1234567890",
    company="Sample Company",
    service_type="Sample Service",
    location="Sample Location",
    status="Active",
)

# Save the user instance to the database
user.save()

print("Sample user created successfully!")
Exit the Shell:

After running the above code, you can exit the shell with:

python
Copy code
exit()
Option 3: Using Fixtures (JSON or YAML)
If you want to add multiple records in bulk, you can use Django fixtures.

Create a JSON Fixture:

Create a file named users_fixture.json in your project directory (or in a folder like fixtures/) with the following content (modify the fields as needed):

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "model": "users.user",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "username": "user1",
      "full_name": "User One",
      "email": "user1@example.com",
      "phone_no": "1234567890",
      "company": "Company One",
      "service_type": "Service One",
      "location": "Location One",
      "status": "Active"
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "users.user",
    "pk": 2,
    "fields": {
      "username": "user2",
      "full_name": "User Two",
      "email": "user2@example.com",
      "phone_no": "9876543210",
      "company": "Company Two",
      "service_type": "Service Two",
      "location": "Location Two",
      "status": "Deactivated"
    }
  }
]
Load the Fixture:

Use the following command to load the fixture into your database:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py loaddata users_fixture.json
This will insert multiple records into your User table.

Option 4: Using Django Admin ModelForm (Custom Code)
If you need to create a custom form for adding users from your frontend, you can define a ModelForm in your forms.py and use it in a view. Here's how you can do it:

Create a form in users/forms.py (you already have one, so you might not need to do this again).
Define a view where this form is used to add new users.
Render the form in a template where users can enter data.
After running any of these steps, you should see the sample users added to your User table.
